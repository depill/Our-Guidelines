## We take care when deploying - especially to production.
* We do not deploy to production on Fridays unless there are compelling reasons to do so.
* We always smoke test deployments manually to see that things are more or less working after deployment.
* We add high-level automated tests where feasible to ensure no surprises for major workflows in our systems.
